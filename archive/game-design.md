Old Ideas
===


Zork-like game
----------------------

Room-by-room puzzle game that demonstrates the power of the voice recognition system. Rooms should have objects lying around, described in a generic way (a long, thin object on the ground), but the user can refer to it in many ways (sword). Each object has actions mapped to it.

### Room 1

Painting on wall with button behind. sharp object on floor (could use as knife). Cut painting down. Press button. Opens door.

### Room 2

In a dark room, have to turn on the lights (let there be light, lights on)
Key on table, use key to open door (introduce player to the mechanics)


Turn-based RPG-style game
-------------------------

Similar to Pokemon/Final Fantasy. The focus should be removing the need to go through menus to select commands. Make up generic commands to perform actions. E.g. "Use a healing potion", should select any kind of potion/elixer. Any aggressive command ("attack with all you got!") should perform some sort of damage action. Block/dodge should perfrom a defensive action.


A combination of Zork and turn-based battle RPG
---------------------------------

A combination of puzzles and fights with trolls.

A puzzle room. Can look around, inspect objects. As you search, you can pick up items (potions, weapons), to use for battles.

Try to open the door.

After each door is a troll you health you have to fight. Fight using available weapons/fists and use items acquired.
