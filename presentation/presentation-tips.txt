Audeince:
No idea what project is
tired, hungry
thinking about world cup

Get them interested!

First two minutes (script)

Cut to the chase (technical meat)

Example and diagrams

Little or no linking texts

Use outline wisely at beginning

Do make it clear you know the background

Don't say work is rubbish (can think it though)

Have backup slides for quick responses

Avoid revelaing bullet points one by one

Do not rush if out of time, just stop if time is up

Have video of it working as backup
