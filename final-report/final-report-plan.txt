Background:

Cosine similarity of definitions
Deep parsing in Watson

---

__Design__
- Platform choice
- System UML Overview
- Game Design Overview
- NLP Techniques used


Overview:
- Chose Android

System Overview:
Explain slot filling approach
NLP techniques (semanitc similarity)

Explain each step in the flow chart in more detail.

Show a UML diagram of the following:
- MainActivity
- VoiceControl
- GameState
- VoiceProcess (actual NLP engine)
- SemanticSimilarity (singleton, mention Android activity states)
Explain each one

Explain QOL features:
- synonyms
- match ignores
- Confirmation
- multiple commands
- sentence mapping
- multiple targets

Game Design Overview:
- Battle, Overworld, Zork-like
- Show UML class diagram

Game Design Extensions:
- Room descriptions
- Properties of objects (PhysicalObject)

- Performance Engineering (none)


__Implementation__

UI:

General code
- GlobalState
- VoiceProcess
- SemanticSimiliarty
- AmbiguousHandler
- CustomLexicalDatabase
- ContextActionMaps and Action
- Entity
- Action
- Synonym Map code
-- Utensil room in appendix    TODO
- SentenceMapper
- MultipleCommandProcess

CustomLexicalDatabase: mention meronyms, holonyms, etc.

Custom Lesk: mention use of Fernflower decompiler and altered code.

Game implementation:
- "Simple demo rooms were created to demonstrate the system applied to different
settings"
- GameState
- Battle impl (show map)
-- Enemies
-- Inventory and Items
- Overworld impl (show map)
-- Physical Objects
-- Rooms and Room generation
---- General
---- room description (show previous versions in appendix)
---- Add Roomobjects (lamda expressions, boolean suppliers)
---- Example of room1
---- Room generation



Settings UI

Call Example
- Call UI
- Call table (full class in Appendix)
- Ambiguous contacts

Android profiler for performance
- Attempt to multithread
Had locking issues

Testing implementations

__Evaluation__

Mock testing

Evaluation of semantic similarity
(pick action maps to knife instead of grab!)
Evaluation project details
Create table of scores of other methods, link to csvs in project

Evaluation of effectiveness of slot-filling (need sentence mapper)

Evaluation of effectivenesss of learning mechanism

Evaluation of other extensions (multipe commands, confirmation, suggestions)

(By end of Monday)

Evaluate speed of recognition, performance (pc, phone, raspberry pi)
Number of tests:
Overworld: 44
Battle: 67
Total time for all tests: 3m 59s 113ms
WordNet test time: 41s 9ms
Time for other tests: 198104ms = 3m 18s 104ms
Time for one test: 1785ms = 1s 784ms
Speed tests in evaluation section

By end of Tuesday

Evaluate ease of development (adding voice commands, survey)

Evaluate ease of room generation (survey)

Limitations:
- Requires Java code/ Java inheritence hierarchy to be compatible
- Only single-word actions, targets and contexts
- Can't handle negatives (call dan with no audio)
- Action cannot have the same string as target or context
- Ambiguous words (throw the match)
- Lots of targets, few contexts? (ActionTargetMap)

By end of Thursday

__Conclusion__

Contributions
- euicker to add voice commands, no need to hard code
- entirely offline, can be used with embedded systems or robots
- created library
- Created GitHub gist (even if I can't get the Gloss working)
- Explored ideas for ease of room development
 
 Future Work
- Mention language changes
- Combining methods and getting weighting (use ML/deep learning to find best ones)
    -- algoruthnm would leanr weightings for semantic similarities, RNNs
- Multithreading for performance
- Hand-free (wake-word detection) and TTs output

Appendix:
Screeenshots of app
Include github statistics
Other evaluation tests

Note: RRR is a reference location
Don't forget to add references in!!!!!!!!!!!!

Fix double quotes
