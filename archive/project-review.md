Project Review
======

- Inspired to do this project from internship. Implementing voice recognition control on Spark Board was a pain.
- Explain that voice input can be useful in VR games. Mention Nintendogs touch screen controls - transitioning that to voice control.
- Developers can spend a millenia adding all forms of input to their game to be accepted (using STT).
- Goal of this project, design a system that allows developers to add voice commands easily and apply it to an RPG.
- Why? Systems exist but mostly cloud services and require internet. Mostly focused on PAs. Want to build a simple system designed for use in video games that works locally and is simple to use.
- RPG: mixture of exploration (interacting with objects in an environment to solve a puzzle) and turn-based battles with enemies a la Pokemon.
