Slide 1:
Last summer would probably hard-code commands. Now just have to make this table
(show on screen) and I can say all these commands.

-"attack with a sword"
-"hit the troll using something sharp"
-"fight with a hammer and then heal with a potion"
-"launch an assault using a sword and a hammer and then recover"

(Remember to toggle complex battle table back on)

Project was to create a text-based role-playing game, but to decrease the

What if want ot say commands in various ways, synonyms

Show hard-coded, regex; online APIs need money
